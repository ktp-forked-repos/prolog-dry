# Prolog Served DRY

A set of three exercise sessions designed to teach Prolog to master students.
No Prolog background is required, but this is **not** for programming beginners.

Each session was given during a 2 hour session. However, they will probably take
more time to complete (especially session 2 and 3). Maybe twice as much, to do
them properly.
